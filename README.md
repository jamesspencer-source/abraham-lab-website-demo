# Abraham Lab Website

Static Astro site for the Abraham Lab at Harvard Medical School.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` validates and builds the site, checks screenshots, and runs the accessibility/browser tests before publishing that same `_site` artifact. A failed check leaves the previous deployment serving.

Pull requests run the same checks without publishing. A manual run is review-only by default; enable its `publish` input on `main` to publish after all checks pass. The former separate visual-review workflow is consolidated into this release workflow to avoid duplicate runs.

## GitHub Pages configuration

This repository is intended to publish through the custom GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

In GitHub repository settings, set `Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source` to `GitHub Actions`.

If Pages is left on a branch source, GitHub will try to run its built-in Jekyll workflow against the Astro source tree at the repository root. That produces the failing `pages build and deployment` run seen on `main`, even when the custom Astro deploy succeeds.

The repository root and `public/` both include `.nojekyll` markers so a branch-based fallback will bypass the Jekyll build. The authoritative deployment path is still the custom Actions workflow.

The content research notes live under `references/` rather than `docs/` so the repo no longer looks like a branch-published `/docs` site.

## Content validation

```bash
npm run validate:content
```

This checks publication title/DOI/PMID consistency, homepage proof ordering, and the canonical institutional wording used across the site data modules.

Run `npm test` for offline regression tests covering paper selection, roster grouping, and publication-monitor failure handling. CI uses Node 24.

The homepage feature defaults to the most recent dated research article, independently of the hero figure and preprint curation flags. To intentionally feature another verified paper, set `siteData.publicationRecord.homepageDoi` to its DOI. A preprint override is labeled "Recent preprint". Unknown DOI overrides fail validation.

`siteData.graduatePrograms` contains general Contact-page program names. `siteData.trainingPrograms` resolves individual program tags on Team; MD-PhD combinations belong to those individual records only. Allowed current roster groups are shared by the data type, renderer, and validator so a misspelled group cannot silently hide a person.

## Publication record

```bash
npm run check:publications
```

The checker compares the local record with PubMed and bioRxiv and writes a read-only report to `output/publication-check/`. Update `siteData.publicationRecord.checkedAt` only after both sources complete successfully and any candidate records have been reviewed.

Unavailable or incomplete sources produce a partial report and a failed check, not a successful "no changes" result. The checker never edits the public record or its review date.

## Image optimization

The full-resolution, open-access homepage figure is retained under `references/source-assets/`. Rebuild its responsive WebP files after replacing that source:

```bash
npm run images:optimize
```

## Visual review

```bash
npm run visual:setup
npm run visual:review
```

This captures screenshots for all public routes across the required desktop, tablet, and mobile viewport matrix and writes artifacts to `output/visual-review/`.

For quicker local passes, you can scope the run:

```bash
VISUAL_REVIEW_ROUTES=home,publications VISUAL_REVIEW_VIEWPORTS=390,768 VISUAL_REVIEW_THEMES=light npm run visual:review
```

`VISUAL_REVIEW_ROUTES`, `VISUAL_REVIEW_VIEWPORTS`, and `VISUAL_REVIEW_THEMES` all accept comma-separated lists.

On some local macOS environments, headless Chromium can fail with a MachPort permission error even when the Astro build succeeds. Use a review-only manual run of `Deploy site` for the CI test artifacts. Browser permission blocks are separate: resolve the permission before reviewing that site in another surface.

## Accessibility and browser review

```bash
npm run quality:setup
npm run quality:review
```

The quality review checks the automated WCAG 2.1 Level AA rule set, keyboard navigation, text-spacing resilience, 320px reflow, light and dark modes, legacy route handoffs, and layout behavior in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It covers phone, tablet, laptop, wide desktop, narrow-window, and short-wide-window shapes.

Reports are written to `output/quality-review/`. The release workflow runs these checks against the build it will publish and uploads screenshots, reports, and logs under `site-review-<commit>`, including when a check fails.

## Contact map

The page provides an outbound Google Maps link without JavaScript or third-party requests. `Show map` creates a compact iframe only when activated; `Hide map` removes it. The directions link remains available when Google is blocked or unavailable. An iframe load event is not treated as proof that Google rendered a valid map.

Automated testing does not establish full WCAG conformance. Complete the manual checks in `references/accessibility-release-checklist.md` before the custom-domain launch.
